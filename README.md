# NumberWordConverter

Assuming the user enters the number 253:

The program starts by creating a Scanner object to read user input.

The program prompts the user to enter a number with the message "Enter Number: ".

The user enters the number 253.

The program converts the input number 253 to a string and assigns it to the str variable.

The program initializes a character variable c with the value 0.

The program prints the value of c, which is 0.

The program enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the string str (which is "253").

Iteration 1:
c is assigned the value '2'.
The switch statement matches '2' and prints "Two".
Iteration 2:
c is assigned the value '5'.
The switch statement matches '5' and prints "Five".
Iteration 3:
c is assigned the value '3'.
The switch statement matches '3' and prints "Three".
After the loop ends, the program closes the Scanner object and the program finishes.
